  <p>This breadstick recipe is savory with a combination of butter and garlic compounded with parmesan cheese.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar, divided<li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water, divided</li>
    <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup Parmesan cheese</>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Dissolve 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Beat flour, oil, egg, salt, remaining sugar, and remaining warm water into yeast mixture until smooth, adding more flour if needed to form a soft dough. Turn dough onto a floured work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to cover completely with oil. Cover bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm area until dough is doubled in size, about 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grease a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Punch dough down and turn onto a floured work surface. Divide dough into 18 pieces and shape each into a 6-inch rope. Arrange dough pieces on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart; cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove cover from dough.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Whisk butter and garlic salt together in a bowl; brush over each breadstick. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over each.</li>
  </ol>
